# LiteForge DEX

Live site: **https://liteforgedex.com**

LiteForge is the native DEX of **LitVM LiteForge** — an EVM rollup that pulls its security from Litecoin's proof-of-work. You can swap tokens, bridge real LTC in via the Grail bridge, stake LITVM for a cut of sequencer fees, and even spin up your own ERC20 in one transaction.

This repo is the frontend.

## What's inside

- **Swap** — trade any registered ERC20 against zkLTC, sub-second settlement, oracle-backed pricing
- **Bridge** — move real Litecoin into zkLTC trustlessly via BitcoinOS Grail (no wrapped custodians, no multisig)
- **Stake** — lock LITVM and earn a proportional share of sequencer fee revenue, paid in zkLTC
- **Forge** — deploy capped, burnable, pausable ERC20s in a single tx, instantly listable
- **Airdrop** — snapshot-based distribution with on-chain eligibility, tiered into Forgemaster / Ember / Spark
- **Activity** — full per-wallet history (swaps, bridges, stakes) with real-time volume
